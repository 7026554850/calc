# calc
A regular calculator with basic functions.
# Begins with
1. storing the first operand in a variable called num1 as a string to enable multi digit numbers
2. storing the first operator in a variale called operator1 
3. storing the second operand in a variable called num2 as a string to enable multi digit numbers
4. storing the next operator in a variable called operator2
5. calling the function operate() which performs the calculation using the operator1 upon num1 and num2, and returns the result. To enable chained calculations, the result of the first function call is assigned to num1 and the num2 is entered by the user and the function is called again and this time the calculation is done by the operator2 which was assigned to operator1 after the first function call. This looping goes on untill the user keeps entering numbers.
